        <P>
            One of the most exciting highlights of this month that I had an Instacart X TKS Project on improving the shopping experience for Instacart customers.

        <H2 id="static-is-the-new-dynamic">Learning üìö</H2>

        <P>
            I don‚Äôt know what exactly happened but I am enjoying coding more than anything nowadays, maybe because my focus is getting better! I coded a handwritten digit recognition learner from scratch, a Proof-of-Concept for Operational Transformation, and learned a lot of React best practices while coding for my DeFi project.
        </P>
        <P>
            I also learned how to use PyTorch and started with Deep Learning for Coders with Fastai and PyTorch book and I think it‚Äôs the best resource I came across until now.
        </P>

        <H2 id="static-is-the-new-dynamic">Next Month ‚è≠Ô∏è</H2>

        <P>
            I‚Äôll continue reading the Deep Learning for Coders with Fastai and PyTorch book and I am planning to work on a small project :) I am also trying to spend 1 hour a day doing coding challenges and will be reading about Mental Models for this month.
    </P>

        <P>
            One thing I‚Äôll try to do this month too is to publish some articles.
